A little bit more about myself. When I was 26 years old, I decided to discover my potential, therefore I decided to leave my comfort zone.  
I resigned my job as a University Instructor, 
leaving Malaysia for the United States to pursue my master's degree in Information Technology at the University of South Florida (USF) in Tampa, FL. 
Then, I continue working for my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering in 2018 to expand my knowledge, especially in Data Mining, Machine Learning and Evolutionary Algorithm.

I faced many challenges in the United States, such as having a big culture shock. 
Fortunately, coming from a multicultural country, I constantly met new and diverse people, 
making me an adaptable and friendly person able to build global connections anywhere. 
I met a lot of friends and professors at USF who have given me support and encouragement. 
I can now integrate both cultures from the eastern side and the western side, it makes me a more open-minded data analyst. 

What Doesn’t Kill You Makes You Stronger. I have strong work ethic and team spirit. Meanwhile, I am also passionate, reliable and creative.
